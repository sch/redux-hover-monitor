## Redux Slider Monitor

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux-slider-monitor.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-slider-monitor)

A custom monitor for use with [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools).

The `SliderMonitor` component is intended to be integrated into your app as a **complementary UI** for your application â€” a devtool that blends into the background and is available when you need it to go back to a previous state in your app.
